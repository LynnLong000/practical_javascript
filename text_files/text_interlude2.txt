JS data types 
 Objects (can be as complex as you want )

{}  todoList , arrays , functions

Primitives (building blocks) 

String       'look at this string' 
Number      1,2,3,4
Boolean    true false 
undefined    value that hasn't been set 
null    nothing 


comparsion   Primitives (values) // just like math 

'lynn' ===  'lynn'    // true
'lynn' === 'lynn1'  // false


comparsion with objects are defferent

{}  ===  {}  // false

[1,2,3]  === [1,2,3]  // false 

when comparing objects like house they can be exactly the same but it is trying to compare the address (memory address ) 

Objects (references ) 
when they say the references memory address or reference to that value
